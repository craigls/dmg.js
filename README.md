# Game Boy emulator in JavaScript

I got inspired while watching the youtube channel of Modern Vintage Gamer. 
In a video, he discusses Game Boy emulation and how it is easy to implement. 
So I wanted to try it for myself. 

The emulator is able to run a few games (like Tetris, Super Mario Land, Link's Awakening)
but there's lots of bugs and missing features (sound, memory banking, etc).
This project is just for fun and shouldn't be used as a reference.

## How to run it
Open dist/index.html in a browser, load a Game Boy ROM file (not included)

## Controls
| key | button |
|---|--|
| w | up | 
| s | down | 
| a | left | 
| d | right | 
| j | b | 
| k | a | 
| u | select | 
| i | start |
