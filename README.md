# Game Boy emulator in JavaScript

I got inspired while watching the youtube channel of Modern Vintage Gamer. 
In a video, he discusses Game Boy emulation and how it is easy to implement. 
So I wanted to try it for myself. 

The emulator is able to run Tetris and it is basically playable, but there are bugs 
and many missing features. This code shouldn't be used as a reference of any kind. 
It's just for fun.
